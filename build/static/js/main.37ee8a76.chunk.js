He was hospitalized for 1 month - in which he spent 3 weeks in the ICU. Erik was Treated as a burn victim and had several eye procedures done while in the ICU. He lost 70% of his skin. He has currently been diagnosed with the vanishing bile duct syndrome. This is a very rare condition... none of the doctors we have seen have seen this in any patient before. So he will be placed on the transplant list in hopes of a new liver. Aside from his liver he developed scars in his eye lids. Which will require more surgeries.  Knowing that there is NO chance of a full recovery our hopes are that we can help him with any current and future medical needs.  So please if you are able to donate anything - It would mean so much to him/us. If you cant we understand. However We would ask that you please say a prayer for him and share this page...

She suffered serious injuries such as having her right arm ripped open to the bone from underarm to wrist severe contusions to her neck and back; the impact caused Rosies ear to be torn off which exposed the cartilage. Her family immediately picked her up and sought help they took her to a place where they thought would help her; they took her to the Downey Shelter believing that the shelter would help keep Rosie alive. That was the furthest from reality. Luckily for the family Lisa Corona saw the family and asked if Rosie was sick once Lisa saw Rosie she knew that Rosie needed help-the shelter was not going to help Rosie but kill her once they convinced the family to surrender her.   Rosie is now at Dr. Werbers office receiving the care she needs to recover from her injuries she had surgery on Wednesday to re-attach her ear to her skull   she is having surgery again today to do a debridement on her right leg to completely clean the bone area   scrape off the necrotic skin   tissue from her ligaments. Rosie is going to need long term bandage changes while her right arm is allowed to grow new skin (think of very bad burns on a human)   they will continue the cleaning process to scrape the dead tissue every few days for a few months until she is completely healed.  Please donate any amount you can funds will be directly given to Dr. Werber for saving Rosies life.  Thank you for your generosity and love for Rosie and her family.

We were not prepared and are still waiting for his LTD to be processed.  In the meantime we are expected to pay not only the household bills but are hit with having to pay his insurance and medical expenses in order to continue treatment.  We have reduced the bills including giving up my car (loan and insurance costs) but the medical costs are coming in.  The goal above covers his out of pocket expenses so far insurance costs and what we anticipate still to come from surgeon and hospital.  We know everyone has their own problems but if you can help with a few dollars we would greatly appreciate anything to help this battle and allow Reggie to focus solely on his recovery and not the stress of finances.  Reggie is a proud man and hates to ask for anything from anyone so I took it upon myself to create this page and ask for help.

If you didnt know. Im sure you can understand the horror we felt when we were notified. We did not have time to think. Just react. The shock is still sinking in.   Marco suffered multiple fractured vertebrae 7 broken ribs and a collapsed lung. The doctors had to perform a\xa0craniotomy to alleviate the hemorrhaging in his brain from the impact. His lungs and liver shifted in the crash and suffered internal bleeding from these injuries. He was in an induced coma for 5 days.    First and foremost my apologies if I did not personally inform you and you heard it through the grapevine. If you know my brother you know he is very private. And when it comes to family matters so am I. I had to ask Sonia his beautiful wife if I could open this account. They dont want to ask for money. But I have been here with them from the beginning and I can already see the struggles ahead. Everyone wants to know how they can help and Prayers are the most important. But they have a family and he is still in very critical condition. He has a long road ahead of him for recovery. The trips across the bridge and parking fees add up quickly.\xa0 And these will be necessary as outpatient rehab is in store. He wont be able to work for a while and Sonia as well. And you know as well as I do that the bills dont stop when life might feel like it has come to a screeching halt.    I humbly ask if you truly want to help please donate what you can. I created this account for anyone who wants to help but doesnt know how. It is always awkward to ask for things. I am not shy in asking for what I know will benefit my big brother and his beautiful family. My niece and nephew are their world. Im sure many of you know this. My brother is a hard workingman he works his fingers to the bone to provide for his family as Im sure you all do for your family. And right now this will not be possible until he fully recovers.   I thank you all for your time and your thoughts and prayers. I hope you know how much this will help and anything is appreciated.

On Thanksgiving \xa0Yaasmeen was feeling ill. Common cold sore\xa0\xa0throat. A \xa0friend offered her an antibiotic pill that her friend had from a previous illness. She was thinking that it would help her but this would be the biggest mistake of her life. \xa0After taking the pill  Yaasmeen started experiencing burning in her throat eyes and mouth. As the night went by her eyes became blood shot red and the lining of her lips was already \xa0torn off. \xa0I rushed her to the ER . The drs immediately diagnosed her with Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. \xa0Something \xa0Ive never heard about. \xa0Immediately I googled Stevens Johnsons \xa0and I began to panic. In \xa0my mind I knew this couldnt happen to my baby but deep down in the pit of my stomach was a terrible terrible feeling. Within 4 days \xa0Yaasmeens appearance was transformed. I \xa0watched my daughters skin burn blister bubble n peel off and there was nothing I could do about it. \xa0The pain and agony she was going through just tore my heart to pieces. She was transferred to UCIrvines \xa0burn unit. On December 5th she has surgery to scrape the top portion of her body. She was wrapped in biobrane. 2days later the bottom portion of her body was scraped. As you can see in the photo she was wrapped in bandages from hed to toe. My daughter was intubated so she couldnt communicate with me. i made sure i prayed over her daily I spoke to her daily and reminded her that she had a daughter that loved her very much. Everyday i told her to fight for her life. Yaasmeens blood was infected and she has had 5 blood trasfusions. As we got closer to recovery she had a set back. She was having a hard time breathing. After multiple exams of her trachea they noticed her airway was closing so she had an emergency tracheotomy. she had her trach for 6months. There have been times where she \xa0had trouble \xa0breathing. She had another surgery in april to open her airway because it closed and the steriod injections didnt work. On my birthday June 18th she had surgery to reconstruct her trachea. She was able to sing happy birthday to me as soon as the anesthesia wore off. Best gift ever! Today 6/25 Yaasmeen had her stitches removed. Yay! \xa0Her left eye is very damaged she will need a cornea transplant. Hopefully in 6-8 months when she is healthier we can face that surgery. As for now she will just work on getting healthier and spending a lot of time with her daughter Khloe and return to CSULA! This whole expierence has taught me to never take my children for granted. I almost lost my daughter to 1 pill! She never smoke or drank she is a good kid that was on the right path. I just cant understand why this happened the way it did.

Queridos amigos - por Octavio Hernandez\xa0  En las buenas y en las malas se le mide el pulso a la ciudad y a los amigos. En las buenas se se celebran los logros y se comparten como con El Arca de Ne\xf3n (radio) Duelo deRebeldes (concurso) La Frontera Aqu\xed (festival) el TijuaNeo (impreso y digital) etc. Con los que apoyamos con pasi\xf3n y profesionalismo la cultura la m\xfasica y el arte tanto local como nacional y californiana.\xa0En las malas se busca el apoyo y la solidaridad de los amigos y aliados en la eterna batalla de la vida. Hago p\xfablica la\xa0noticia de que en diciembre de 2013 le comenz\xf3 una extra\xf1a enfermedad a mi dama pareja socia y compa\xf1era de la vida Rosalba Velasco. Con dolores en las piernas y p\xe9rdida del equilibriomes tras mes fue empeorando hasta terminar lamentablemente en silla de ruedas. Es un trastorno neuorol\xf3gico motriz que si tiene cura pero en Tijuana tras consultar a muchos m\xe9dicos de varias especialidades no tuvimos suerte gastamos un dineral y nadie la pudo curar.\xa0Hace algunos meses la enfermedad nos super\xf3 y se fue con su familia a La Paz para consultar un especialista que le recomendaron y est\xe1 en espera de que consigamos los recursos para poder llevarla con m\xe9dicos alternativos en el DF y Monterreyciudades que tienen cl\xednicas en las que puede recuperarse siguiendo el consejo de un m\xe9dico amigo. Por tal raz\xf3n iniciamos hoy una campa\xf1a para obtener apoyos en base a donaciones de la cantidad que les sea posible por este medio de GO FUND ME. E igual realizaremos algunos eventos a beneficio en Tijuana a los cuales les invitaremos en fecha pr\xf3xima para que nos acompa\xf1en. Agradecemos a los amigos m\xfasicos que nos apoyar\xe1n e igual estamos abiertos a recibir propuestas de otros artistas actores bailarines o artistas pl\xe1sticos etc que quieran apoyarnos en este dif\xedcil momento.\xa0Hemos sido fuertes ante este enorme reto porque sabemos que saldremos adelante con la ayuda de Dios los santos y los \xe1ngeles y de los que nos quieren y estiman y aprecian todo lo que hemos hecho por esta hermosa ciudad a la que amamos y por el tr\xe1nsito de la cultura de Los Angeles a la frontera. Ahora nuestra prioridad es que mi \xe1ngel en desgracia se cure y vuelva a sonre\xedrcomo antes.  \xa0  Mil gracias a todos.

Cristina was diagnosed with scoliosis in the fall of 2014.   This page was set up to help support Cristina\u2019s scoliosis treatment. Cristina will begin her treatment journey by having Vertebroplasty (back surgery) during the winter break of 2015.\xa0 At which point 10 of Cristina\u2019s vertebrae will be fused by doctors from Shriners Hospital of Los Angeles CA.   \xa0Cristina\u2019s family was recently told that she has a very aggressive form of scoliosis. The conventional scoliosis treatment of bracing and physical therapy are not a treatment option for her because of the aggressive nature of her condition.  In the past 6 months her curvature has gone from less than 43 degrees to 58 degrees and is expected to progress at a rate of 2 degrees per month. With the onset of adolescent growth the curve and rotation of her vertebrae will continue to worsen.\xa0Our only treatment option is spinal fusion surgery. However because she is only 11 traditional fusion with titanium rods and bone grafting are not the treatment option that will have the most beneficial outcome for Cristina. Traditional fusion will limit her range of motion and not allow her to grow normally.   Cristina is full of life an amazing daughter an\xa0excellent student energetic artistic vibrant and a lover of Arts. Cristina has been a dedicated Folkorico dancer since the age of 7.\xa0 The emotional strain that she will feel of not being part of her dance troop will most definitely be more than the physical pain for her.    The road to recovery will not be an easy one physically emotionally and financially. Her parents have taken time off of their jobs to be close to their daughter but as we all know the bills of everyday living do not stop.There will also be upcoming medical expenses that will need to be covered and a long list of pre-surgery purchases that are needed\xa0 such as an orthopedic bed art supplies dog emotional support training and license (her dog is her best friend) alternative rehabilitation classes (Meditational training) financial burden of missing work \xa0and the list goes on and on.        Please I ask all of my family friends friends of family etc. to please help us help Cristina and her family in this hour of need. Cristina is a fighter and she will overcome this!  We are kindly asking you to help support us in this endeavor. Any contribution you wish to make towards Cristinas surgery and recovery would be greatly appreciated.\xa0If you are not able to make any contribution by all means  Please share share share this page . If we get 1000 shares and 1000 people donate $1 then Cristina will have $1000. I am setting the goal high because just the expense of the bed is scary.   \xa0We thank you in advance for your generosity compassion and prayers for this little Warrior.   \xa0Blessing to you today tomorrow and always.

Unfortunately the school directors are retiring and our beloved Woodroe Woods School will be closing in June of 2016.   There has been an overwhelmingly positive response from the teachers and parents of Woodroe Woods who are collaborating to open a new school. There is a profound need for quality early childhood education and childcare \u2013 for the children for the parents for the community. This is one profession where dedication and experience are crucial.   We need your help!  While we are working to find a new location there is an immediate need to raise funds to help with covering the significant expenses of starting up a new school. The funds we raise will go towards the purchase of the following items:  - Portable Classrooms - Architectural Lot Improvements - Moving Expenses - Permits - Licensing - Legal Fees - Playground Equipment (Climbing Structures Swings Slides Sandbox etc.) - Indoor Furniture (Tables Chairs Cubbies Bookcases Toy Storage Bins etc.) - Art Supplies - Appliances (Washer Dryer Vacuum Cleaner Telephone System Fans etc.) - Cleaning Supplies (Brooms Dustpans Mops Detergent etc.) - Office Supplies (Paper Ink Staplers etc.) - Office Equipment (Computer Copier Printer/Fax Filing Cabinets Desks etc.)  With roughly 160 Preschool through 2nd grade students attending Woodroe Woods each academic calendar year (and many families on the waiting list) the impact of this school closure on this community is great. Additionally our fun and educational summer camp enrolls an additional 50 students through 4th grade each year. Without this program many families will be scrambling to find quality childcare for the summer.  The children parents and teachers of Woodroe Woods will be so grateful for your support. With your help we are confident we can make this dream a reality. We look forward to serving this community for decades to come.

I would like to ask you for some financial support to give her proper barrial services and lift some economic burden off her husband and our familiy. Any little bit helps.

Many of you might not know but throughout the years Pix has been slowly losing his vision. At first we all thought that his vision was getting worse because of the time and his age but during the last doctor\u2019s visit in November 2015 we knew something wasn\u2019t right. The Optometrist we saw said that he could have glaucoma and he sent us to see an Ophthalmologist. We found many of them but none in our network of insurance. At one point Pix was ready to give up and just live with the fact that he would be losing his vision little by little. I finally convinced him in getting it checked out. We found an ophthalmologist in town that would take him ASAP. The Ophthalmologist said we would have to pay for the visit in full and not including any extra test  if required.The first thing we thought was \u201cHow are we going to pay this?\u201d $300+ just for the visit and plus the extra test.    After a few test the Ophthalmologist recommended we get Pix an MRI done due to the test results. He has lost complete vision of his right eye and half of his left. At the time I thought \u201cHow can he live like this?\u201d We were scared but determined to get him the help that he needs. Now we had to find a radiology office that was \u201cin network\u201d once again no luck. 1k out of pocket for the MRI. They told us we could see the results during our next doctors appointment. It wasn\u2019t long before his doctor called us a couple hours saying we needed to come to his office immediately. So many thoughts were rushing through our minds what could it be? All this time we thought it was Glaucoma and that he just needed a better prescription for his glasses. We were completely blind sided.   We were then told that Pix has a Pituitary Adenoma tumor that is located in the top center of his brain and it is pressing against his optic nerve which is causing him to lose his vision. We were sent to Stanford to meet with a Neurosurgeon but were later denied because of our insurance. We then were sent to another Neurosurgeon in Monterey. We weren\u2019t seen there because they said it was too large for him to perform the surgery. After being bounced back and forth to different doctors lost wages due to appointments  paid hundreds of dollars to be seen by them we were finally sent to UCSF. Rated top 4 in the country. With that title we were sure that a huge price tag came with it. Our insurance was in network but wasn\u2019t able to pay it all.    Now on June 7 2016 Pix will finally have his surgery!! The downside to it all is we have spent a lot of money in just getting to where we are now. We are struggling to pay for his surgery. The surgery will take place in UCSF and will require pre and several post-op visits. Out of pocket costs which include the amount not covered by insurance as well as travel expenses will run approximately $10000. We have hit a roadblock and we need your help. We are glad that the doctors were able to find the tumor before it grew any larger. The tumor is the size of a tomato now and at any given moment it can damage the optic nerve enough that he can go blind and stay like that for the rest of his life. This surgery is very important because Pix has two small children who he wishes to see every single day while they grow up. It would be devastating to not be able to pay for this very important surgery. Any little counts all will be greatly appreciated!

The Lord has invited me to become an applicant member of the  Madonna House  Apostolate on September 8th of this Holy Year of Mercy!  I\xa0spent last year living there as a guest. I\xa0lived their life; serving working praying and taking classes in their Fall and Spring Programs.\xa0At the end of my time there Jesus invitation in my heart to come back and stay became clear: to find Him love Him and serve Him wholeheartedly in this community one day at a time through Mary by His Grace. Theres many amazing things about the community and so many difficulties and things I would never choose but this yes is to His voice and invitation alone.\xa0May His mercy continue to pour and lead!    Im entering as an applicant... Applicancy is two years of\xa0formation after which God willing promises are made: For the glory of God and because I desire with my whole heart to respond to the call of Jesus Christ... to live in\xa0poverty chastity and obedience according to the spirit and mandate of Madonna House.\xa0    Their spirit in a word is\xa0 Nazareth; \xa0to live love work and serve as the\xa0Holy Family in Nazareth in all aspects of life. This is also to live with the Lords Grace His command to love; particularly serving and being one with the poor. The community is often called The People of the Towel and the Water.    Living the Gospel and restoring the world to Christ is expressed at Madonna House in a variety of ways as is Loves\xa0endless creativity: - serving one another in all ordinary matters of life doing little things exceedingly well for love of Christ - spiritual formation programs for young people families and men discerning the priesthood - service to the local community especially to the poor - evangelization through publications (newspaper books music etc) talks retreats listening spiritual direction art music etc. -\xa0providing a divine milieu to guests who come year round (like me!) -currently\xa018 mission houses through Canada the U.S. Belgium Cariacou Britain and Russia each with their particular mission expressed by the heart of the Madonna House spirit. - restoring the earth through Christ through what the foundress called apostolic farming - Love love love never counting the cost....\xa0  Convinced that this call is not only for me but for the entire Body of Christ I invite you to support me :).  I beg for your prayers for me and for my family during this time!\xa0Our joined prayers in His Name will continue to unite us as a Body and will bring forth abundant graces.\xa0 All Glory be to God !   If you are also able to support in some financial way itd be an enormous blessing; whatever is in your heart and are able.\xa0I know theres many needs at this time certainly for you personally and for our Christian and non-Christian family so I do not ask unaware of that. I ask being unable to get there save by Gods Providence in whom my trust rests and in whom I place you as well. To get there I need to take care of some medical immigration and travel expenses (Im a Mexican citizen and currently\xa0living in Mexico) and some cover for the winter\xa0(Combermere is quite cold :O). If some of it winds up not being used by me I will make sure it goes to the poor.\xa0   Thank you for reading me and your support! I place all in Christs and Our Lady of Combermeres hands! \xa0 If you have any questions please contact me at sofia289@gmail.com!

On Sunday July 14 2016 Julianna Corona developed a severe headache and nausea that landed her in the hospital. The doctors performed a MRI scan which proved to be abnormal. The doctors told Julianna and her family that she had 2-3 brain tumors. On Monday July 15th Julianna had her first brain surgery in which they biopsied her tumors and removed one. On Thursday July 18th Julianna was officially diagnosed with the most common and most aggressive brain cancer called Glioblastoma Multiforme (GMB). The doctors have discovered 7 cancerous tumors on the left side of her brain. GMB is a grade IV cancer that is not curable and is terminal. Julianna needs aggressive treatments of Radiation Therapy and Chemotherapy to prolong her life. The Corona family is completely devastated.    Julianna Corona is a young beautiful mother wife daughter and sister. Julianna is a 28 year old stay at home mother of three beautiful girls aged 9 5 and 2. Up until Sunday Julianna was still breast feeding her youngest daughter. Julianna is married to Pedro Corona a hardworking and well-loved DonJon Marine employee in the C   M Metals Recycling division in Dover NJ. Julianna and her family need our help. Her loving husband Pedro is the sole provider for her and their 3 children. Pedro has been unable to go to work since her diagnosis because he has been by her side in the hospital while also caring for their three beautiful girls. Julianna needs to start treatment immediately to prolong her survival. She will be having Radiation Therapy daily on her brain in addition to daily Chemotherapy. Due to complications with medical coverage none of\xa0 her Chemotherapy medications as well as future treatments are covered at this time. Julianna and Pedro are in desperate need of our financial support. Julianna has so much to live for. She loves her husband and three children so much and all she wants in life is to watch them grow and be there for them. Julianna desperately needs to start the Chemotherapy medication in order to prolong her life as long as possible.   There comes a time in everyones life where help is needed and the Coronas urgently need ours. Please donate to this beautiful family that needs our help. By helping get Julianna the proper medication and alleviating financial burdens would mean the world to the Corona family. No one knows how much time Julianna has left but helping this family financially for medical costs and inability to work at the present time would ease a huge burden for them so they can enjoy what time they have left.

This unexpected diagnosis hit hard on her and her family. She is a daughter mother wife grandma and will fight this battle with God on her side!   Because pancreatic cancer is the deadliest of cancers there was an urgency for treatment. The doctors werent concerned about it too much and have not tried their best to help her. There was no other choice but to look for better options. Her kids searched for hours and hours at a time and came across a better solution. The clinic that we have been led to is American Holistic in Mexico. The clinic features more highly effective treatment options under one roof than any other cancer clinic and it has done well in treating pancreatic cancer patients. This is an expensive program though and is not covered by insurance. The treatment costs range from $45000 to $50000.   Debbie has finished treatment but in the meantime the medical bills(including treatment) are piling high. There has been so much support from family and friends to make the trips to and from Mexico the accommodations and meals. All of this support is so much appreciated and we love you all for reaching out and helping Debbie and the family in this time of need. What we are asking is that you donate any amount that you feel in your heart(it doesnt matter how little) and please spread the word and share this page.   We refuse to let this disease tear us down. We are in good spirits and we continue to rely on God as the joy of the Lord is our strength and the strength of the Lord is our joy.   Our family has set a goal to raise $50000 and all funds donated would go specifically to the costs of her medical expenses (plus the fees charged by GoFundMe).   Throughout this journey we have been blessed with so many people giving us prayer and love. Several have asked what they can do to help. Contributing to the cost of Debbies treatments would be a blessing. We would be so grateful for your donations.   We have strong faith to believe that God will move people to help us and we do believe He will completely heal Debbie in Jesus Name!   As a mother wife grandmother Debbie still has so much more to experience with her family. Thank you so much to all of those who would like to help. God bless you abundantly for your generosity. Your loving gift will be received with great appreciation!

Twenty years ago I sat in a British Literature class at CWU and found my dream. I wanted to study in\xa0London. It was always a pie in the sky/wouldnt it be cool if sort of dream. My practical side kept going to school built a full-time teaching career and established a pretty rewarding life. I am a professional student. Which probably explains why I am also a teacher. Meanwhile that\xa0dream always floated out there--waiting. \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Until last spring. The dream sat down in my lap and took up residence when I was least expecting it. Through a series of open doors and gentle shoves from God I applied for a Fulbright Scholarship to attend an innovative interdisciplinary program at  Royal Holloway  University of London. To complete my scholarship application I had to also apply to the school itself for admittance. Deep in my heart I knew that I knew that I knew God had led me to this opportunity and \xa0I could not ignore it. \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Now I face a\xa0conundrum. I have been accepted to Royal Holloway to begin my  program  in September 2017. However I learned at the end of January that I did not receive the Fulbright Scholarship which\xa0would have covered a\xa0large bulk of the cost for me move to attend school live in and then return from the UK. \xa0My conservative estimate is that I need at least $50000 USD to fund everything for a year.\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Asking for money in this fashion is WAY outside my comfort zone. In the past I worked my way through school. Slowy but surely everything has always been paid off. \xa0However that isnt an option this time around. I need the bulk of the money up front and the rest to live on for the year since if I can work it would be only on a limited part time basis. Im applying for other smaller scholarships but even together they would only cover a small fraction of the cost -if I win them. A\xa0friend recently encouraged\xa0me that I only need 5000 people to give $10. \xa0I dont know 5000 people. But the six degrees of separation adage is totally true. So even though I dont know enough people all my friends do! If\xa0God has truly called me to this opportunity then He will fund it - Im just trying to make all the options available to Him!

It progressed to the point he went to the emergency room for treatment. Going undiagnosed Brandon was sent home where his condition continued to worsen. After having a couple episodes of passing out his family brought him home to South Florida for additional testing.  Doctors were able to discover a serious brain condition that required immediate surgery. Following the surgery he was sent home to recover where his symptoms returned\u2026 this time worse. Rushing back to the doctor\u2019s office it was discovered that the previous surgery was not successful and another procedure was needed. After the second emergent brain surgery doctors found the pressure on his brain needed to be better controlled. Brandon is scheduled today (March 2 2017) to undergo a third brain surgery to remove a portion of his skull to relieve the pressure pushing on his brain.  The Corona family has been a pillar in the community. Hector Corona Brandon\u2019s father is a Battalion Chief with the Margate-Coconut Creek Fire Department. He has been a member of the fire department for 29 years and has dedicated his life to helping others in their time of need. Brandon\u2019s mother Julie Corona has been a registered nurse for over 30 years. She has worked in emergency medicine home healthcare and hospice care. Both of his parents have given support to many families throughout the community by hosting fundraiser event and giving their time volunteering.

He recently completed his PHD in leadership and was scheduled for graduation June 16 2017. Unfortunately he will not walk during a much anticipated graduation and instead will be confined to a hospital bed for post surgery recovery. During a routine checkup he was told he had artetial plaque in 6 different locations and would immediately require an extensive quadruple bypass. As you can imagine this was heartbreaking news for someone who is active and has never had any major medical issues. After the surgery he will be out of work for several weeks which will cause a heavy financial burden on him and his family. After insurance pays their part he is still left with a bill of $75000. This is going to cost a lot of money time patience people and God\u2019s hands with the surgeons. So all we are asking is for a little help to lift the burden off his shoulders so he can just focus on getting better. The funds would be used to offset the costs of bills. Every dollar counts and we just ask that you give as God has given us. In the event that you cannot donate prayers are free and are always needed. Thank you and God bless.  ? 2 Corinthians 9:7 ?

In my six years of life I went to the hospital many times because of my conditions but in so short time I also got to enjoy the beautiful things of life like family friends my doctors and nurses and the joy of being a kid. For example the time I visited Disney World in Orlando thanks to the Make-A-Wish foundation!! In October 2016 thats when things got complicated... I was sent to UCLA for advanced studies and to see if I would qualify for a heart transplant.. After four days of studies I did not qualify... my parents were also told that the doctors we were running out of options. I got the opportunity to get sent home to celebrate my last Christmas my last New year ...my last birthday. Months after I turned SIX I went back to UCSF for a surgery that would either save my life or take my life... I made it... but even then my family never lost hope and prayed for a huge Miracle along with prayers from people Sent from all around the world. My last battle was hard and I fought hard but God had other plans for me and decided my mission here was done. On July 25 2017 at about 5:30 AM Jesus came for me and took me to a place where there is no pain no suffering a place where I could watch over my loved ones. He took me to heaven. I ask you to help my family with My expenses.. Anything would help!!
